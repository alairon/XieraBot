# XieraBot
A Discord bot to help with numerous ARKS operations. Originally an excuse for the creator to learn TypeScript and OOP.

## Current Status
* Due to SEGA's shift to randomized events for both Phantasy Star Online 2 (PSO2) and Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis (PSO2:NGS), the bot will no longer be able to provide information about upcoming events.

## Completed Features
* Scheduled UQ search, including commonly used aliases (e.g. _Barren Blossom: Corruptor of All_, Profound Darkness or PD will show the same results)
* Upcoming casino boost events.
* A handy feature to show how much time you have before dailies/weeklies reset.
* Daily crafting tables (currently collecting data since it differs from the JP version)
